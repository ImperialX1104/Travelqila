# Travel Qila

This GitHub project is a web application for a travel agency website that allows users to search for and book travel packages. The website features a user-friendly interface with a responsive design that is compatible with different devices and screen sizes.

The website's main page displays featured travel packages with their descriptions, prices, and images. Users can browse through different categories of travel packages, such as adventure, beach, culture, and luxury, and filter the results based on their preferences, such as destination, duration, and price.

Users can create an account on the website to save their preferences, view their booking history, and receive personalized recommendations. They can also contact the travel agency through a contact form or a live chat feature to get more information or assistance with their bookings.

The website integrates with third-party APIs to provide real-time information on flight schedules, hotel availability, and other travel-related data. The website also includes a payment gateway that enables users to securely pay for their bookings using different payment methods, such as credit cards, PayPal, or bank transfers.

The project uses modern web technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, and Node.js, and follows best practices for web development, such as code modularity, scalability, and security. The code is well-documented, tested, and maintained on GitHub, allowing other developers to contribute to the project and improve its functionality and performance.
